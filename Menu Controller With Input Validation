-- The purpose of this code is to control a menu pop up when a player wants to play for a different team in game. This code involves input validation and front-end development.

-- Declarations
local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local ownsGamepass = game:GetService("MarketplaceService"):UserOwnsGamePassAsync(player.UserId, 16191129)
local prompt = game:GetService("MarketplaceService")
local remoteEvent = game.ReplicatedStorage.changeTeam
local menuButton = script.Parent:WaitForChild("menuButton")
local frame = script.Parent:WaitForChild("Frame")
local policeColor = "Deep blue"
local criminalColor = "Deep orange"
local mafiaColor = "Really black"

-- The codes below control the menu that allows for the changing of teams.
frame.Robbers.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
	remoteEvent:FireServer(BrickColor.new(criminalColor))
end)
frame.Cops.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
	remoteEvent:FireServer(BrickColor.new(policeColor))
end)
-- This piece of code controls the menu as well but involves input validation for paid content that comes with the game
frame.Mafia.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
	if ownsGamepass then
		remoteEvent:FireServer(BrickColor.new(mafiaColor))
	else
		prompt:PromptGamePassPurchase(player, 17580610)
		print("This player doesn't own the in game content") -- Currently a placeholder for a display message to the player that will let them know they need the paid content.
	end
end)

-- This makes the menu open & close
menuButton.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
	frame.Visible = not frame.Visible
end)
