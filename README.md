<h2 align="center">This file will showcase beginner, intermediate, and some advanced code in the language: LUA</h2>

<br/>

<h3 align="center">All of the coding examples in this file have been created from scratch based on a code for my complete game I created and still update to this day. The game has had over 3,500 players with minimal advertising and has been shown to make a profit. This game houses a little over 100,000 lines of code and is completely a solo project. The link to the game will be listed below.</h3>
